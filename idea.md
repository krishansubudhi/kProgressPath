# Initial Idea
I want to build a goal tracker android app.
It has the following features.
1. set daily, weekly and monthly goals . Example read 5  books every month
2. Update goal status for this date/week/month with reminder
3. Visualize the status for current date by default with option to visualize status for previous dates, weeks and months. 
4. Visualize status for each goal across day/weeks/months
5. Settings page. 

Page 1:
I am thining the home page should show goals  for current date, current week and current month with option to update the goal status. This should also contain a floating button to add a new goal. 

Page 2:
Then there should be another page in menus to edit or modify all the goals , frequency, quantity etc  and also see their historical and current status.

Page 3: 
See historical status based on date/week/month by picking from a calendar.


Page 4:
Settings

**ChatGPT Suggestion**
Given this refined design, here’s a breakdown of the final UI pages and some recommendations to get you started:

### Final UI Pages
1. **Home/History Page (Combined)**: Displays current goals (daily, weekly, monthly) and allows users to update, view, or edit each goal. Includes a calendar or date picker to view past goal statuses and a floating button to add new goals.

2. **Goal Edit Page**: A dedicated screen for creating, editing, or deleting goals. It will allow users to modify details like frequency, target quantity, and start/end dates. This page may open as a modal or full screen when accessed from the Home page.

3. **Settings Page**: Offers options for reminders, notifications, and other customizable settings.

### Getting Started
Since it’s been a decade since you last worked with Android development, here’s a suggested approach to refresh your skills and start building:

1. **Refresh Android Development Skills**
   - **Kotlin**: Android development now primarily uses Kotlin. If you haven’t used it yet, start with basic syntax and Android-specific Kotlin features.
   - **Android Architecture Components**: Familiarize yourself with current best practices, like using ViewModels, LiveData, and Room (for local databases).
   - **Jetpack Compose**: Android’s new UI toolkit, Jetpack Compose, is much more modern and declarative than XML-based layouts. It’s worth learning if you want a simplified, flexible UI design experience.

2. **Set Up Your Project Structure**
   - **Define Models**: Start by creating models for your goals, progress tracking, and settings. Room can manage these models with minimal boilerplate.
   - **Database**: Implement Room Database for local storage, with tables for Goal, Progress, and Settings data.
   - **ViewModel and Repository**: Use ViewModel to hold data and Repository to abstract data sources.

3. **Develop Core Features in Phases**
   - **Phase 1**: Home/History Page, focusing on displaying current goals and updating progress.
   - **Phase 2**: Goal Edit Page, enabling goal creation and modification.
   - **Phase 3**: Add calendar functionality to the Home page for historical tracking.
   - **Phase 4**: Settings page, including reminder and notification settings.

4. **Prototype and Test**: Test each feature thoroughly on different devices and screen sizes. Use Android Studio’s emulator and deploy to your phone to get a feel for real-world usability.

### Next Steps
1. **Follow Android Dev Guides**: Android’s official docs are highly updated and cover essentials like navigation, UI components, and Jetpack libraries.
2. **Start with a Small Feature**: Create the simplest version of the Home page first—displaying and updating a daily goal—then gradually build out the remaining functionalities.
3. **Iterate and Gather Feedback**: Regularly test and refine your app design. Consider sharing a test build with a small group of users for early feedback.

With these steps, you should be able to refresh your skills and build a solid, modern Android app tailored to your vision.
